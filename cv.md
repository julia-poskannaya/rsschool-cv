## About me:

Some time ago, I became interested in the IT sphere and began to study the professions that exist in it.
My journey began with immersion in the profession of a web designer. I completed the course, where I got to know the profession better. After completing the course, I realized that although the profession is interesting, I wanted to know how applications work inside. I got interested in front-end development. I studied the profession in courses, video lessons and on my own. Now I continue my studies, because I want to improve my knowledge, study technologies in depth, gain experience.  
Learning front-end development is a difficult and long path that looks like a maze, but I believe that I will have the strength and patience to go through it.
